								<h2>How we dreamt and How we fail</h2>
								<p>A story of failed Enterpreneurship<br />
								“Failure” is indeed a privilege and we had that privilege. So, like any other hormonal teenagers who are in their eighteens we squandered that privilege. We failed at becoming the next gen entrepreneurs in our own classic confusing way and this is our story.</p>

								    <h3 class="major">Introduction</h3>
								    <p>Those were the days when the word ‘Entrepreneurs’ is almost romanticized every other alternative week in news around us. The stories of Flipkart, Oyo founders filled the much-needed infatuation and lust in us. The journey of starting a new company and minting millions seemed easy and possible. We looked around us and thought “why don’t we do that?” and boy we did. We did indeed start like any others dreamers at that point. We dreamt!</p>
								  

									<h3 class="major">Main Story</h3>
									<p>Ideas were thrown, discussed and debated every day during lunch, dinner and sometimes in the middle of classes. A group is formed that is diverse in tastes, interests and goals. The crush on ‘Entrepreneurship’ is such that in those almost every alternative individual is excited to talk. A pact is formed in between the group. Without a solid idea, agreements were drawn, shares are shared among each and profit margin was decided behind each other backs in a silent hiss.<br />
									What we had at that time was one project idea. A basic half working idea that functioned and modified along the way. We figured everything on our own. Everybody laughed at us. From what we could scrape we did. At the end of the day, we didn’t have a working prototype and even many iterations after we didn’t have a working prototype. All we had was confidence, sometimes overconfidence that people will believe in our idea and give us millions. With belief that the same would happen we travelled a lot, met many people and pitched many decks.<br />
									We thought we could make a dent in the universe with our idea. All we did is put a dent in our own pockets financially, we strained our relationships and friendships. We couldn’t stand the harsh reality outside. Most importantly we were not able to accept the reality that demanded during that time. How can we? We are merely dreamers and we only dreamt all through the way mostly about minting millions.</p>

                <div class ="inner">
									<h3 class="major">End of the story</h3>
									<p>Thank God we were in Engineering during that time. So, in the last 2 years of our studies we could bear this privilege of failure and coming to terms with the reality of starting a company that will earn millions.<br />
									But once we were out of the protective cocoon of studies. Reality harder than ever. Job became priority. Politics came into play. Every other known close friend turned into a dominating double tongued devil. Words were exchanged and pacts were broken. Agreements were rewritten and Shares got reshuffled with new percentages. It became a habit to crumble. Main Foundation base started to get cracks. What started out as a team sport soon became into a one-man battle. After not much long time that one man too shook hands with himself and parted ways.</p>

							<h2 class="major">Epilogue: Points to be noted</h2>
							<p>1. Finding the right team is always important. People who are passionate about the idea are important<br />
							2. An idea and its execution need to be a team sport. Same set of skills are needed but not necessary in the team.<br />
							3. If you feel you can’t escape rat race don’t think about Entrepreneurship.<br />
							4. A company will start making millions only in the 5th year of its journey.<br />
							5. Hungry for money don’t become entrepreneur. Study hard and get a job.<br />
							6. Thinking to start a company and actually starting a company are two different ball games.<br />
							7. If you are not receptive to suggestions don’t bother in gathering a team. Be a solo founder.<br />
							8. Problems are many but ideas to solve them are very few. A great idea will take time.<br />
							9. If you are working a team, you have to work for the team. The team will never work for you.<br />
							10. If you need money don’t start a company. Please. Study hard and get a job</p>
