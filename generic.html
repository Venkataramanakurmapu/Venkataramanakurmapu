							“Failure” is indeed a privilege and we had that privilege. So, like any other hormonal teenagers who are in their eighteens we squandered that privilege. We failed at becoming the next gen entrepreneurs in our own classic confusing way and this is our story.</p>

										<p>The reason behind my early departure from team was my own career plans which are not aligned with team.<br />
										  Honestly speaking I find fire in you occasionally. People were not valuing the time. Everybody expecting from the team and forgot that they were part of the same team. Everybody felt themselves "I don't have knowledge about this task, so it is ok if I don't do anything about it, somebody will take care of". But there shouldn't be any excuses like this. Finally I thought that I was incapable of coordinating you people and it would be better to maintain your priceless friendship. That continued. And in the end I ought to say sorry to some people because I was not honest with them.</p>

										<p>Everybody wants a happy ending. Right? But it doesn't always roll that way. we may encounter many defeats, but we must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats, so we can know who we are, what we can rise from, how we can still come out of it.   beyond that i am a lucky person, because of us. my dear friends....</p>
